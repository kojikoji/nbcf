This is a package for calculating change point for time course multi negative binomial observation. The algorithm of change point finding is based on [Fearnhead et al. 2005](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1433145), I apply it to multivariate negative binomial situation. Furthermore, this package aims to detect the variate whose distribution is significantly changed across each change point. Coming soon.
